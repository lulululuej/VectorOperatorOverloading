# Vector Operation
### this is a practice for operator overloading

### the functionality of the program
* initialize the vector,
* negate the vector,
* add and subtract vectors from each other,
* multipliy a vector with a constant (both from the left and the right),
* divide a vector with a constant,
* print a vector to arbitrary streams,
* read a vector from a stream,
* calculate the dot product of two vectors,
* compare vectors for equality and inequality,
* get the length of the vector,
